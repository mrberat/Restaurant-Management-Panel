# Restaurant-Management-Panel

We wanted to assist one of FEBS FOOD BURGER KING restaurants under the TAB GIDA umbrella by reaching an agreement with them. During our discussions with the management, they mentioned that they didn't have any issues with daily reports but faced difficulties with reporting in the long term. They had four years' worth of data, but it was disorganized and messy. We undertook efforts to organize and report this data. Our initial goal was to meet the restaurant's needs. To achieve this, we prepared various charts and tables according to their requests. We reported the obtained data on a monthly, yearly, and daily basis. In the ongoing process, we designed a page with personnel data using various formulas to meet the staffing needs. We fulfilled the restaurant's requests extensively. At the end of the project, we understood how the chain restaurant operated and what its fundamental needs were. After discussions with the management, our project, which positively affected the operation, enabled the business to make clearer decisions. We also learned that with the rise in inflation, businesses now focus on the number of guests rather than revenue as a measure of success.
